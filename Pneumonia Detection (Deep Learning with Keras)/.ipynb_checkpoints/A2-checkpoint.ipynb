    "- Threshold: Denoted by the solid grey line in figure 2, The threshold value in the decision tree model acts as a measure to prevent overfitting by restricting tree depth when the reduction in RSS \n",
    "(benefit from a split) becomes too low. The constant threshold value of ~15 means that if no factor can provide a reduction of RSS greater than 15 then we cannot split the tree. \n",
